This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow

My name is Sam and I am a business intelligence professional excited to broaden my skills. I have to two vibrant kiddos and two rambunctious pups. I enjoy playing video games, cooking, and pursuing creative hobbies of all kinds in my free time. I am also a founding member of a fledging dnd streaming group that's been running for about 2 years.

This should be a change occurring in the new-branch branch of the hello-world repo via git cmds in terminal.
